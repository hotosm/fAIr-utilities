Run Container with default Jupyter Notebook , Or add `bash` at end to see terminal

[Optional] If you have downloaded RAMP already , By Default tf is set as Ramp_Home , You can change that by attaching your ramp-home volume to container as tf

if not you can skip this step , Ramp code will be downloaded on package_test.ipynb
